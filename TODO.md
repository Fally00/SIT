# TODO List for Modifying systemInfoL.cpp

- [x] Remove unwanted header includes from systemInfoL.cpp, keeping only the first 4: "systemInfo.h", <fstream>, <sstream>, <iostream>
- [x] Fix compilation errors by replacing POSIX functions with standard C++ alternatives
- [x] Add comments explaining the changes and library uses
